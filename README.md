## Hello World

Hey gang welcome to my crappy programs...


## Derivative Visualizer

`derivative_visualizer.py` animates the derivative of a user supplied function. It prints the tangent and normal line through a chosen x value and shows the moving tangent along the curve.

Run it with Python 3 and the `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `sympy` packages installed:

```
python3 derivative_visualizer.py
```

You will be prompted for the function and x value.
