Figure 16 shows an incomplete Python program to create a bingo ticket for a player.
The programmer has used a two-dimensional array called ticket to represent a
bingo ticket.
The program uses a subroutine called generateKeyTerm. When called, the
subroutine will return a random key term, eg "CPU"
"ALU"
,
,
"NOT gate" etc.
Complete the Python program in Figure 16 by filling in the five gaps.
â€¢ Line numbers are included but are not part of the program.
