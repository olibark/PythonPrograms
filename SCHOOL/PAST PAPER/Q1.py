1. A student is developing a program to calculate the average of three test scores.
a) Write pseudocode to input three test scores and output their average.

"""b) Identify and explain one potential error that could occur if a user inputs non-numeric data.

"""A potential error is a Value error. THis happens when a user inputs a data type (e.g. string or charavter) that cannot be converted into an integer."""

"""2. Consider the following algorithm:
Set total to 0
For each number from 1 to 5
    Input score
    Add score to total
Output total
a) What is the purpose of this algorithm?

""""The purpouse of this algorithm is to calcuate the total of 5 scores""""
b) Modify the algorithm to calculate and output the average score.
