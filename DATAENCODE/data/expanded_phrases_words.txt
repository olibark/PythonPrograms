A penny for your thoughts
Carpe Diem
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts"
The early bird catches the worm
"To be, or not to be"
Live and let live
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
The only way to do great work is to love what you do
A watched pot never boils
Knowledge is power
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step
Fortune favors the bold
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind
"I think, therefore I am"
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity
To thine own self be true
The grass is always greener on the other side
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
All that glitters is not gold
Actions speak louder than words
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Better late than never
Brevity is the soul of wit
Curiosity killed the cat
"Do as I say, not as I do"
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't cry over spilt milk
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has its day
"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me"
Good things come to those who wait
He who hesitates is lost
Hindsight is 20/20
"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen"
Ignorance is bliss
It's always darkest before the dawn
It's never too late
"Jack of all trades, master of none"
"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"
Laughter is the best medicine
Let sleeping dogs lie
Live in the moment
Look before you leap
Make hay while the sun shines
Necessity is the mother of invention
"No pain, no gain"
One man's trash is another man's treasure
"Out of sight, out of mind"
Practice makes perfect
Rome wasn't built in a day
Silence is golden
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
The best things in life are free
The pen is mightier than the sword
There's no place like home
Time is money
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Two heads are better than one
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do"
What goes around comes around
"What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve"
"When the going gets tough, the tough get going"
"Where there's a will, there's a way"
"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't judge a book by its cover
A picture is worth a thousand words
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Actions speak louder than words
Add fuel to the fire
All's fair in love and war
A fool and his money are soon parted
A stitch in time saves nine
Beauty is only skin deep
Better safe than sorry
Birds of a feather flock together
Cat's out of the bag
"Cold hands, warm heart"
Count your blessings
Curiosity is the key to knowledge
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
"Don't ask, don't tell"
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Don't judge a book by its cover
"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise"
"Easy come, easy go"
Give the devil his due
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard
I have a dream
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
"If you want something done right, do it yourself"
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It's not over until the fat lady sings
Laughter is the best medicine
Let the cat out of the bag
"Live, laugh, love"
Love is blind
Love makes the world go round
Money can't buy happiness
One step at a time
Practice makes perfect
Put your best foot forward
Rags to riches
Rome wasn't built in a day
The best is yet to come
The early bird catches the worm
The grass is always greener on the other side
The only way to have a friend is to be one
The truth will set you free
There is no time like the present
Time flies when you're having fun
Tomorrow is another day
"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear"
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
You reap what you sow
A penny for your thoughts
Carpe Diem

"When the going gets tough, the tough get going"
"Where there's a will, there's a way"
"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't judge a book by its cover
A picture is worth a thousand words
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Actions speak louder than words
Add fuel to the fire
All's fair in love and war
A fool and his money are soon parted
A stitch in time saves nine
Beauty is only skin deep
Better safe than sorry
Birds of a feather flock together
Cat's out of the bag
"Cold hands, warm heart"
Count your blessings
Curiosity is the key to knowledge
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
"Don't ask, don't tell"
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Don't judge a book by its cover
"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise"
"Easy come, easy go"
Give the devil his due
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard
I have a dream
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
"If you want something done right, do it yourself"
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It's not over until the fat lady sings
Laughter is the best medicine
Let the cat out of the bag
"Live, laugh, love"
Love is blind
Love makes the world go round
Money can't buy happiness
One step at a time
Practice makes perfect
Put your best foot forward
Rags to riches
Rome wasn't built in a day
The best is yet to come
The early bird catches the worm
The grass is always greener on the other side
The only way to have a friend is to be one
The truth will set you free
There is no time like the present
Time flies when you're having fun
Tomorrow is another day
"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear"
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
You reap what you sow
A penny for your thoughts
Carpe Diem
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts"
The early bird catches the worm
"To be, or not to be"
Live and let live
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
The only way to do great work is to love what you do
A watched pot never boils
Knowledge is power
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step
Fortune favors the bold
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind
"I think, therefore I am"
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity
To thine own self be true
The grass is always greener on the other side
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
All that glitters is not gold
Actions speak louder than words
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Better late than never
Brevity is the soul of wit
Curiosity killed the cat
"Do as I say, not as I do"
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't cry over spilt milk
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has its day
"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me"
Good things come to those who wait
He who hesitates is lost
Hindsight is 20/20
"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen"
Ignorance is bliss
It's always darkest before the dawn
It's never too late
"Jack of all trades, master of none"
"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"
Laughter is the best medicine
Let sleeping dogs lie
Live in the moment
Look before you leap
Make hay while the sun shines
Necessity is the mother of invention
"No pain, no gain"
One man's trash is another man's treasure
"Out of sight, out of mind"
Practice makes perfect
Rome wasn't built in a day
Silence is golden
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
The best things in life are free
The pen is mightier than the sword
There's no place like home
Time is money
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Two heads are better than one
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do"

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
The only way to do great work is to love what you do
A watched pot never boils
Knowledge is power
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step
Fortune favors the bold
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind
"I think, therefore I am"
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity
To thine own self be true
The grass is always greener on the other side
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
All that glitters is not gold
Actions speak louder than words
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Better late than never
Brevity is the soul of wit
Curiosity killed the cat
"Do as I say, not as I do"
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't cry over spilt milk
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has its day
"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me"
Good things come to those who wait
He who hesitates is lost
Hindsight is 20/20
"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen"
Ignorance is bliss
It's always darkest before the dawn
It's never too late
"Jack of all trades, master of none"
"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"
Laughter is the best medicine
Let sleeping dogs lie
Live in the moment
Look before you leap
Make hay while the sun shines
Necessity is the mother of invention
"No pain, no gain"
One man's trash is another man's treasure
"Out of sight, out of mind"
Practice makes perfect
Rome wasn't built in a day
Silence is golden
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
The best things in life are free
The pen is mightier than the sword
There's no place like home
Time is money
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Two heads are better than one
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do"
What goes around comes around
"What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve"
"When the going gets tough, the tough get going"
"Where there's a will, there's a way"
"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't judge a book by its cover
A picture is worth a thousand words
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Actions speak louder than words
Add fuel to the fire
All's fair in love and war
A fool and his money are soon parted
A stitch in time saves nine
Beauty is only skin deep
Better safe than sorry
Birds of a feather flock together
Cat's out of the bag
"Cold hands, warm heart"
Count your blessings
Curiosity is the key to knowledge
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
"Don't ask, don't tell"
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Don't judge a book by its cover
"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise"
"Easy come, easy go"
Give the devil his due
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard
I have a dream
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
"If you want something done right, do it yourself"
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It's not over until the fat lady sings
Laughter is the best medicine
Let the cat out of the bag
"Live, laugh, love"
Love is blind
Love makes the world go round
Money can't buy happiness
One step at a time
Practice makes perfect
Put your best foot forward
Rags to riches
Rome wasn't built in a day
The best is yet to come
The early bird catches the worm
The grass is always greener on the other side
The only way to have a friend is to be one
The truth will set you free
There is no time like the present
Time flies when you're having fun
Tomorrow is another day
"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear"
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
You reap what you sow
A penny for your thoughts
Carpe Diem
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts"
The early bird catches the worm
"To be, or not to be"
Live and let live
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
The only way to do great work is to love what you do
A watched pot never boils

You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't judge a book by its cover
A picture is worth a thousand words
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Actions speak louder than words
Add fuel to the fire
All's fair in love and war
A fool and his money are soon parted
A stitch in time saves nine
Beauty is only skin deep
Better safe than sorry
Birds of a feather flock together
Cat's out of the bag
"Cold hands, warm heart"
Count your blessings
Curiosity is the key to knowledge
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
"Don't ask, don't tell"
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Don't judge a book by its cover
"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise"
"Easy come, easy go"
Give the devil his due
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard
I have a dream
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
"If you want something done right, do it yourself"
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It's not over until the fat lady sings
Laughter is the best medicine
Let the cat out of the bag
"Live, laugh, love"
Love is blind
Love makes the world go round
Money can't buy happiness
One step at a time
Practice makes perfect
Put your best foot forward
Rags to riches
Rome wasn't built in a day
The best is yet to come
The early bird catches the worm
The grass is always greener on the other side
The only way to have a friend is to be one
The truth will set you free
There is no time like the present
Time flies when you're having fun
Tomorrow is another day
"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear"
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
You reap what you sow
